# Letter_Recognition---Neural_Network
Using neural networks to recognise diferent letters by thheir pixel properties. 
Created a fill multi-layered perceptron, from scatch, which utlises the standard Gradient Descent Backpropogration algorithm. 
I did not incoporate any deep-learning libaries in this application.
